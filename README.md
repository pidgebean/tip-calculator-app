## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project helped me learn a little bit more about programming websites with Javascript, since there were some things that I had to look up on how to do in order to get it to work. It also helped me practice working CSS Grid, since I usually just use flexbox.


### Continued development

There are a couple problems with this project as it stands. On several mobile screens, part of the content is pushed off the screen, and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. As soon as I figure that out, I'll update this project.
